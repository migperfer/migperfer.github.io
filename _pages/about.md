Welcome to my website! I'm Miguel, a researcher, frustrated musician, and a (*probably* annoying) coffee snob.
I have extensive experience with Deep Learning technologies applied to many fields, from audio analysis to computer vision.
Here you will find more information related to my research as different ways of contacting me. 
Do not hesitate to do it! I'm always happy to discuss my research and possible collaborations.
