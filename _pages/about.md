Welcome to my website! I'm Miguel, a researcher, frustrated musician, and a (*probably* annoying) coffee snob.
My main interests in audio research revolve around Music Information Retrieval, concretely music transcription, 
harmonic analysis, and score-to-audio alignment. Here you will find more information related to my research as different
means to contact me. Do not hesitate to contact me, I'm always happy to discuss my research and possible collaborations!
