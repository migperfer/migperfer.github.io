Loops are a essential tool for many music producers, specially for those who make electronic music. Nowadays, the vast
amount of loops resources exceed human management capabilities, and so exploring such loop libraries becomes complicated
; and even more to asses all the combinations of loops that might produce a pleasing result. In this work we compare
different techniques to asses the harmonic compatibility between loops in electronic music.
