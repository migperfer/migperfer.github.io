Singing voice transcription is a key task in Music Information Retrieval (MIR) that focuses on identifying sung notes within a music audio segment. 
Advancing state-of-the-art methods in this area relies heavily on high-quality data, yet annotating such data is resource-intensive and requires musical expertise. 
In genres like pop music, data sharing is further complicated by copyright and distribution limitations. In this paper, we refine a recently proposed data augmentation technique that leverages AI-generated music audio to address these data-related challenges. 
Specifically, we create musical accompaniments for vocals with known target notes, enabling the generation of new mixes that retain the original pieceâ€™s harmony while introducing substantial audio variation. 
Our cross-dataset experiments reveal that using harmony-matched mixes improves generalization, though performance remains below that achieved by training with additional real data.
