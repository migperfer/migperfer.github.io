Note-level automatic singing transcription, which involves extracting both time boundaries and accurate pitch from a singing voice, remains a significant challenge in Music Information Retrieval. 
Despite advancements in deep learning, progress is constrained by the labor-intensive task of annotating datasets, leading to ongoing data scarcity. 
To tackle this, we introduce a novel audio-to-score alignment algorithm that effectively synchronizes timed events between score and audio. Our method not only delivers precise alignments but also includes a mechanism to evaluate their reliability. 
Using this approach, we developed a Singing Onset Labels Extracted Automatically dataset, which facilitated training a model on a diverse range of musical genres and achieved state-of-the-art performance in singing onset estimation for pop music. 
We plan to make both the alignment algorithm and the Singing Onset Labels Extracted Automatically dataset publicly available for use by other researchers.
